# Refactor-Minnesota-Income-Tax-Calculation

# Purpsose

The goal of this project is to reengineer a legacy Java application. At a glance, serves for the income tax calculation
of the Minnesota state citizens. The tax calculation accounts for the marital status of a given citizen, his income,
and the amount of money that he has spend, as witnessed by a set of receipts declared along with the income. The
legacy application takes as input txt or xml files that contain the necessary data for each citizen. The tax calculation
is based on a complex algorithm provided b the Minnesota state. The application further produces graphical
representations of the data in terms of bar and pie charts. Finally. the application produces respective output
reports in txt or xml. 

More information about the issues and the refactoring methods that we used to resolve them are being explained in the file "finalReport.pdf"
and at the "demo_Video.mp4" (greek Language)
